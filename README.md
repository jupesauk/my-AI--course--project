# AI Project for mteching up achievemnets in diffreent sports

Final project for the Building AI course MOOC at Uni of Helsinki

## Summary

To construct a "machine" to comapre the psorts achievements of different (in age, experience, etc.) in different sports and give universal scores  


## Background

This is observed as a not problem but additional feature to the current phenomenon of quantified self and debates of "betterness" within people interested in sports

The outputscould be used for
* motivation
* fun
* reward systems


## How is it used?

The users = performers feed in their "demographic data" as results achieved, AI then analyzes the e.g. probabilities of reaching that level by "people like you" doing the same thing and thus comparison of seemingly distant events.  


## Data sources and AI methods

Data comes from existing athtlete profiles and pubished results as well as user-input (over time) + potentially of the data analysis apps of smartwatch providers. The wisdom of crowds can be added by "votings" of the users in valuing achievements against each other.

## Challenges

The number of parameters to give a "fully fair" assessments would by huge (conditions of environment, daily variation in condition etc.). But for a "for-fun" solution that would not be that harmful. The aim is not to en dthe dabate but give it a new angle.

There already is a German-based mobile app SPOBI running on a sme "problem"...

## What next?

With no coding capability (come from business background) of my own it would be nice to hear if people with tech skills would be interested to dig that side out...


## Acknowledgments

Thanks to my student Daria "Dasha" Khaskina who studied and gave feedback on the idea as part of her studies, being a tech- and entrepreneurship-minded business person herself. The "competition" running partly on the same fuel can be found at: https://spobi.net/
